Hakbot Origin Controller
=====================================

A minimalistic Java Web Application (Servlet) that provides the queuing and processing of jobs over JSON.

**This project is under heavy development and may be unstable. Use at your own risk.**

Background
-------------------

In software development, it is essential that security tools are integrated into every step of the
development process. Sometimes, custom tools and scripts may be necessary to integrate with continuous
integration servers, the security tools, and the target application being tested.

This is why the Hakbot Origin Controller came about. The controller accepts incoming jobs over JSON/HTTP,
places the jobs into a queue for processing, and when worker threads are available, the jobs will
be processed.

Jobs can be anything ranging from executing shell scripts to controlling dynamic analysis engines.

The Hakbot Origin Controller is not designed to be a security application. It's designed for integrating into
the build process via continuous integration. Basic security features are implemented, but best-practices
should be employed.

Features
-------------------

* Configurable queue and job engine
* Sequential or simultaneous execution of jobs from the same provider
* RESTful endpoints that respond with JSON
* Swagger2 support
* Embedded database engine (H2)
* Requires Java 8 or higher

Providers
-------------------

Providers are the integration points that can be controlled through the Hakbot Origin Controller. Writing
a custom provider is straight-forward and simply involves extending the BaseProvider class.

Providers included are:

* Shell - Executes any shell command or script
* AppSpider - Performs AppSpider Pro (formally NTOSpider) dynamic analysis
* Nessus - Performs a Nessus scan against one or more targets

Publishers
-------------------

Publishers take the result generated by a provider, such as the result of a Nessus or AppSpider scan, and publishes
them in some way.

Publishers included are:

* FileSystem - Saves the results to the filesystem
* ThreadFix - Upload the results to ThreadFix for vulnerability aggregation and normalization

Use Cases
-------------------

### Automating AppSpider Pro
AppSpider Pro only allows one simultaneous scan to take place at any given time. In order to automate dynamic analysis
using AppSpider Pro, a queuing system must be used to stack the jobs in sequential order. Additionally, multiple
AppSpider Pro instances (scanners) can be defined, each scanner with it's own URL, username, and password. This
is the basis for the AppSpider Enterprise offering, but without all the additional benefit (and limitations) of using
AppSpider Enterprise. If organizations simply want to automate one or more instances of AppSpider Pro, this project
may be of benefit.


### Limiting Scan Fatigue
A scan, regardless of provider, may take a large amount of network bandwidth or consume host resources. When multiple
scans are being performed by different tools, it may be desirable to limit the fatigue caused by these tools to a
realistic level.


### Auto Publishing Results
If the provider that's executed contains results, those results can be automatically published. Like providers,
publishers perform a specific task; they take results from the provider and do something with them. Results could be
published to a spreadsheet, populated in a database, or pushed to ThreadFix for vulnerability aggregation.


Compiling
-------------------

> $ mvn clean package

Installing
-------------------

The Hakbot Origin Controller can be deployed to any Servlet 3 compatible container including Tomcat and Jetty.
Simply copy origin-controller.war to the webapps directory and restart the servlet engine.

Usage
-------------------

The URL for the API is: http://$HOSTNAME:$PORT/$CONTEXT/api

Swagger JSON is located: http://$HOSTNAME:$PORT/$CONTEXT/api/swagger.json
